You are required to print electricity bill for the no of unit. Units must be given as an input by the user, it will print the electricity bill using:
i. For first 50 units, it will charge Rs 9 per unit
ii. For next 50 units, it will charge Rs 12 and
iii. Above it, it will charge Rs 15.
............................................................................

    The above assignment is implemented using PHP and Basics of HTML.
    I've used If-else logic to generate the bill as per the given conditions.
    I've tried my best to keep the interface as simple as possible.

In this repository one can get the

Details of Test Cases -
Test Case 1 -

    Electricity Bill for 45 Units
    45 < 50
    Therefore, 45 x 9 = 405.0

Test Case 2 -

    Electricity Bill for 95 Units
    50 < 95 < 100
    Therefore, (50 x 9) + (45 x 12)=990.0

Test Case 3 -

    Electricity Bill for 105 Units
    100 < 105
    Therefore, (50 x 9) + (50 x 12) + (5 x 15) = 1125.0
